# Time-series-classification

This repository introduces the categorization of time series and includes code examples and ideas for best practices. Time series classification is an important task in many fields, such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and different industries, where it is necessary to classify time series. The classification of time series can be helpful in various applications, including forecasting stock prices, detecting market trends, and detecting sensor data anomalies.

The objective of time series classification is to determine the class or category of a time series by looking at its historical data and making a prediction about what that class or category will be.The categorization of time series presents several challenging issues. Sometimes time series data are chaotic and have high dimensions, making it more difficult to isolate important features. Another challenge is that time series data is frequently subject to temporal dependencies, which means that the present value of a time series may depend on its previous values. To address these challenges, some techniques have been developed for time series classifications. Including preprocessing techniques such as normalization, feature extraction and path signature, among others.

A number of different classification techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forests, can all be utilized in the process of classifying time series data. In addition, deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers are typically utilized for the purpose of time series categorization. These algorithms and models each have their own unique advantages, and it is possible to choose one of them based on the particular requirements and qualities of the information. LSTM networks are a form of RNN that have been demonstrated to be effective for modeling long-term dependencies in time series data. As a result, these networks have become a popular option for the classification of time series data.

In addition to the methods themselves, it is essential to make use of appropriate assessment metrics in order to evaluate the performance of time series classification models. The terms "accuracy," "precision," "recall," "F1 score," and "area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve" are examples of measures that are utilized frequently. Comparing various models and determining which ones are best suited for a given set of responsibilities can both benefit from the use of these measures. It is imperative that the proper evaluation measure (or metrics) be selected in order to guarantee that the model is well-suited for the issue that is being tackled.

This project's code will be written in Python and will be stored in separate files depending on the technique or algorithm employed. The files will be arranged in a directory structure that follows a categorization of the employed tasks. The code will be modular and reusable so that it can be simply integrated into other projects. To exhibit the outcomes, a Jupyter notebook containing the outputs and evaluation metrics will be developed. This will facilitate the visualization and interpretation of the results, as well as the reproduction and expansion of the work by others.
