# Time-series-classification
This repository introduces the categorization of time series and includes code examples and ideas for best practices. Time series classification is an important task in many fields, such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and different industries, where it is necessary to classify time series.

The following categories of are included in the repository:

<ul>
  <li>Overview of time series classification</li>
  <li>Preprocessing techniques for time series data</li>
